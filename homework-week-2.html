            <p>
                Laetiporus is a genus of edible mushrooms found throughout much of the world. Some species, especially
                Laetiporus sulphureus, are commonly known as sulphur shelf, chicken of the woods, the chicken mushroom,
                or the chicken fungus because it is often described as tasting like and having a texture similar to that
                of chicken meat.

                Grifola frondosa is a polypore mushroom that grows at the base of trees, particularly old growth oaks or
                maples. It is typically found in late summer to early autumn. It is native to China, Europe, and North
                America.

            <h2>
                Morels
            </h2>
            <p>
                Morchella, the true morels, is a genus of edible sac fungi closely related to anatomically simpler cup
                fungi in the order Pezizales (division Ascomycota). These distinctive fungi have a honeycomb appearance
                due to the network of ridges with pits composing their caps. Morels are prized by gourmet cooks,
                particularly in Catalan and French cuisine. Due to difficulties in cultivation, commercial harvesting of
                wild morels has become a multimillion-dollar industry in the temperate Northern Hemisphere, in
                particular North America, Turkey, China, the Himalayas, India, and Pakistan where these highly prized
                fungi are found in abundance.
